#Overview 

This repository contains the source code for a simplified email client-server application implemented in Java. The application allows multiple clients to communicate with a server simultaneously, exchanging messages between two users, "Dave" and "Karen". Each user has a mailbox on the server that can hold up to 10 messages.
